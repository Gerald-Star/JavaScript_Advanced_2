//* What is Loops?
/***  Loops are used to repeat a block of code.
 Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
 There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

//* Types of Loops
/***  1. for loop
 2. while loop
 3. do while loop
 4. for in loop
 5. for of loop

/**
 * Challenge 1: Iterate over this array using a for of loop to access each character
 */

//! for ..of and for ..in loops are used to iterate over arrays and objects respectively
//! Arrays are iterable objects, which means they have a Symbol.iterator property, which is a function that returns an iterator object
//! Objects are not iterable, so you can't use a for ..of loop to iterate over them

// ? for..in loop is used to iterate over the properties key of an object

// ? for..of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object like  examples an arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc
